## Description

The Quadratic Function Visualization program provides an interactive way to explore the graph of a quadratic function and observe the convergence of tangent lines at selected points. This tool is useful for gaining insights into the behavior of quadratic functions and the process of finding tangent points using the Newton-Raphson method.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Quadratic Function Visualization, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required Python packages using the following command:
4. Run the `quadratic_visualization.py` script to visualize the quadratic function and tangent lines.

## Usage

Run the `quadratic_visualization.py` script to open the interactive visualization. The program will display the graph of the quadratic function as well as the tangent lines at specific points. You can explore different tangent points and observe how the tangent lines approach the root of the function.

## Features

- Visualizes the graph of a quadratic function and its tangent lines.
- Uses the Newton-Raphson method to find tangent points.
- Allows interactive exploration of the function's behavior.
